## Before you begin
* You will be continuing to work on your API server
* Provided for you is a working server, which you may use as a starter

## Assignment
###### Requirements
* Create a new `mongo` database called `store`
* Add support to the `storage` system to support `mongoose` schemas
* Re-Implement the `categories` and `products` models to use mongo schemas when the `mongo` storage mechanism is activated


###### Testing
* test the full CRUD operations of your server and both models
* use supertest for your route testing so you don't spin up a web server
* use `mongodb-memory-server` as a stand-in for `mogngod` so you don't have to spin up a mongo database to test


##  Documentation
* Include your travis badge at the top of your `README.md` file
* Include your Heroku Server link
* In your `README.md`, describe the exported values of each module you have defined. Every function description should include it's airty (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and it's behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to add any additional information in your `README.md` that you would like.
